# coderedcms website

## Introduction

This is the django application which is needed to run a site based on `coderedcms` (a ready-made but customisable CMS built with [wagtail](https://wagtail.io)). `codered-site` is equivalent to the `mysite` Django project created by the `coderedcms start` command (see [here](https://github.com/coderedcorp/coderedcms)) however the `website` app within that has been replaced by `apptheme_codered` which is the theme package. Minimal customisations/extensions of the example code so far but allows independence.
